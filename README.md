RPGMaker Generator Assets Mover is a tool that makes it easier to move character generator parts into your version of RPGMaker. Whether it's one image or a whole folder, this tool will move the assets as long as they're properly named (ie. face generator parts start with "FG_", SV generator parts start with "SV_" etc.)

The above video has a tutorial on how to use the tool, but if you want instructions without a video, follow along below!

To start, download the releases folder and open the [JAR FILE].

Navigate to your RPGMaker Generator folder. If you right-click on your version of RPGMaker in Steam and click 'Browse local files', you'll be able to find the folder. 

You'll need to get the path of the generator folder and paste it under where it says 
"Please enter the path of the RPGMaker Generator folder"

The path will be saved the next time you open the tool, but if you need to change the path afterward that's still doable.

Next, you will drag in the files and/or folders you want to move into the yellow rectangle. You'll know it's in the list of parts to be moved when you see the folder/file name in the box below the yellow rectangle.

Before we can move the files/folders we want, we have to select the body type these generator parts are for. If there are parts for multiple body types AND they're separated into the appropriate folders titled "Male", "Female", and "Kid", then you should select "All". If you have generator parts for one body type, select the appropriate body type.

Finally, you can hit "Move Generator Assets". It will take a second if there are a lot of files to move, but there will be a results log showing which files were successfully and unsuccessfully moved.

That's it! 

I'm still fairly new to using Java, but wanted to create something that could be useful to gamedev folks!
If there are any issues, please let me know ASAP and I'll do my best to fix it.
